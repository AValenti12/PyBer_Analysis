# PyBer_Analysis
Analyze all the rideshare data from January to early Mary of 2019 and create visualization.

#Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze and visualize ride-sharing data from PyBer, using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We were tasked with creating a report and line chart to show how the company's ride-sharing data differs by city type. 

# Results
In order to visually see and understand the differences between urban, suburban, and rural areas, we created a summary dataframe to breakdown the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and averae per driver.
