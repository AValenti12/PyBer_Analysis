# PyBer_Analysis
Analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 and create visualization.

# Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to analyze and visualize ride-sharing data from PyBer, using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We were tasked with creating a report and line chart to show how the company's ride-sharing data differs by city type. 

# Results
In order to visually see and understand the differences between urban, suburban, and rural areas, we created a summary dataframe to breakdown the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride, and average per driver.  

It is clear to see that PyBer has a higher usage in Urban areas than in other areas. The least demand is in the rural areas. The average fare per ride is higher in the rural areas at $34.62 and the lowest average fare per ride was in urban areas at $24.53. There are a lot more drivers in the urban areas at 2,405 drivers. The number of drivers in suburban areas was 490, and rural with 78. There is a trend between how populated an area is and the total number of rides which then influences the number of drivers, total fare, and averages.

With the line chart below, you can see the different areas usage over time from January 2019 through Aprl 2019. In the rural areas, total fares only reached over the $500 mark once. The surburan areas stay pretty steady btween $500-$1500. And the Urban areas, stay between $1500 and $2500.

# Summary
Given the data and outcomes, for immediate changes, PyBer could probably benefit from investing in the urban areas. As that is where the larger population and usage is. For a longterm goal, they might want to adventure into ways of increasing suburban and rural areas usage. The average fare per ride in suburban and rural areas is higher, this could be correlated to the number of drivers available or possibly the distances they are traveling. If PyBer were to increase the amount of drivers in the rural areas, this could then decrease the fare per ride/driver, but increase the total fares. This may make users more likely to use their services. That would then increase total profit for PyBer.
